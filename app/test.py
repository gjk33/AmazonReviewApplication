Career mode is still the same and the Journey is long, boring and tedious. They clearly only care about FUT which again is no different you just have to start from scratch. The game modes are fun for a couple of games but then forgot about and there is no real reason for the champions League mode. In short FIFA 19 is FIFA 18 with more loading screens and slightly overly complicated menus. Spend a couple of hours transferring players in the settings and you save yourself Â£50. Go buy Spiderman."
